            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                One of the main challenges was implementing real-time updates without compromising performance. 
                I solved this by implementing WebSocket connections with efficient data streaming and implementing 
                a caching layer to reduce database queries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another challenge was creating a responsive layout that maintained usability on mobile devices 
                while displaying complex data tables. I addressed this through progressive disclosure patterns 
                and touch-friendly interface elements.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                The dashboard has been successfully deployed and is used by over 500 users daily. 
                It has significantly improved operational efficiency, reducing data access time by 60% 
                and increasing user satisfaction scores by 45%.
