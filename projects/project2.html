                <span class="tech-tag">React Native</span>
                <span class="tech-tag">JavaScript</span>
                <span class="tech-tag">Firebase</span>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                Cross-platform compatibility was a significant challenge, as the app needed to work seamlessly on both 
                iOS and Android devices. By using React Native and carefully testing on both platforms, I ensured 
                consistent behavior and appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementing offline functionality required careful thought about data synchronization and conflict resolution. 
                I developed a robust sync mechanism that handles edge cases and ensures data integrity.
            </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                The app has been downloaded over 10,000 times with a 4.7-star rating on app stores. 
                Users particularly appreciate the intuitive interface and reliable synchronization features.
