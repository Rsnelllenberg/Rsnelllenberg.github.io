                <span class="tech-tag">Node.js</span>
                <span class="tech-tag">Express</span>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                Ensuring secure payment processing was critical. I implemented industry-standard security practices, 
                including SSL encryption, secure session management, and PCI DSS compliance through Stripe integration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Handling concurrent users during high-traffic periods required careful architecture planning. 
                I implemented caching strategies with Redis and optimized database queries to handle thousands 
                of simultaneous users without performance issues.
            </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                The platform has successfully processed over $500,000 in transactions with a 99.9% uptime rate. 
                The intuitive interface has resulted in a 35% increase in conversion rates compared to the previous system.
