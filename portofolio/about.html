            <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
            <p>My name is Ravi Snellenberg. On this website I showcase some of the coding projects I have completed over the years. This page contains a short introduction about me.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I graduated from TU Delft in September 2025, earning both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, with my Master's specializing in AI and computer graphics, over five years of study. 
            During that time I became deeply involved with the faculty and I was hired for several positions: I conducted research, contributed to coursework, and assisted students during lab hours. 
            I (co-)authored three conference papers, and I presented my master's thesis on visualizing highly multivariate volumetric data at IEEE Vis 2025.</p>

            <p>My passion is computer graphics, from real-time rendering to physics simulations and visualizing complex data (not just dashboard design using existing components). 
            I find that graphics problems tend to be less abstract than areas such as network protocols or cryptography. 
            And maybe more importantly, they usually produce visual results you can see and interact with, which I find very satisfying.</p>

            <p>The programming languages I am most confident with are C++ and GPU/shader programming, since graphics problems often require extremely fast, efficient, and parallelizable code. 
            Though over the course of my studies I've worked with a wide range of languages (Python, Java, TypeScript, SQL, etc.), and I'm confident I can adapt to diverse programming environments and challenges.</p>

            <p>And as a finally, I consider myself fully fluent in both Dutch and the English languages. This is because I am Dutch, but both my studies and many of my hobbies were conducted in English, so I used English more regularly than Dutch for a significant period of my life.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy taking walks because they help clear my head and provide light exercise, I think it's important to stay healthy. 
            I also like to draw or do some 3D modeling as a creative outlet when the urge strikes.
            Above all, I enjoy immersing myself in stories, whether through books or games.</p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/Rsnelllenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-snellenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, or email me at <a href="mailto:ravisnellenberg@outlook.com">ravisnellenberg@outlook.com</a>.</p>        </article>
